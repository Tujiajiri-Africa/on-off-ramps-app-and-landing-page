# AjiraPay On/Off Ramp On Celo and MiniPay

## **Intro**
We're a mobile money on and off ramp solution for MiniPay users across Sub-Saharan Africa

## **Problem**
With the current average inflation rate across Sub-Saharan Africa standing at a high of 8%, almost 57% of locals are at risk of bad debt with zero savings and unable to access proper social amenities and financial services due to the high inflation

## **Our Solution**
To hedge against high inflation and bad debt, we're rewarding and enabling our users to invest in, earn and save in cUSD on MiniPay with as little as $0.078 (KES 10) using the extisting local mobile money payment rails. Curently integrated with M-Pesa

## **What Separates us from our competitors ?**
- Zero withdrawal fees
- 2% initial cashback on cUSD purchases
- Non-custodial, we are decentralized and thus, we do not take custody of user funds, users are in total control of their funds via the MiniPay wallet
- We have introduced a savings module where by our users transact, earn and claim cUSD rewards within a duration of 7 days between each claim to enable savings on MiniPay
